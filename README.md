# SQL_CRUD
## `This repo uses REACT, EXPRESS JS, NODE and MY SQL for frontend, server routes, backend runtime and database respectively`

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts


### `git clone https://github.com/chaluatmaa/SQL_CRUD.git`

### `cd client`

### `npm i`

### `npm start`


#### Also don't forget to do the `npm i` for both the directories.

### `cd ..`

### `cd server`

### `npm i`

### `npm run devStart`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser for client side and [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) for the server side

The only thing you need to add is host, user, password and database in your `index.js` file in server folder which I have removed.
